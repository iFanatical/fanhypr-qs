/* Bar popups, as wlr-layer-shell surfaces.
 *
 * A ShellPopup is a rounded, bordered top-level with Theme.popupMargin
 * padding, placed under the bar widget that owns it. On the dwm build these
 * were override-redirect X windows that took an XGrabKeyboard while open and
 * an XGrabPointer to notice outside clicks; here the protocol does both jobs:
 *
 *   focus    the surface asks for KeyboardInteractivityExclusive, so the
 *            compositor hands it the keyboard as it maps and gives focus back
 *            to whatever had it on unmap. No focus save/restore, no grabs.
 *   dismiss  a transparent scrim surface covers everything except the bar
 *            strip while a popup is open, and a click on it closes the popup.
 *            Popups sit on the Overlay layer and the scrim on Top, so the
 *            protocol -- not creation order -- guarantees the stacking.
 *
 * Leaving the bar uncovered keeps click-to-toggle and click-another-pill
 * working exactly as they did under X11. The one behavioural difference is
 * that the dismissing click is consumed by the scrim instead of being
 * replayed to the window underneath, which is how every Wayland shell
 * behaves; there is no protocol for replaying it. */
