# Grant a group read access to the kernel's RAPL energy counters, so the bar's
# power-draw widget can report CPU package watts without running as root.
#
#     sudo tools/install-rapl-udev.sh [group]
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED
#
# /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:*/energy_uj is mode 0400 on most distributions.
# That is deliberate: RAPL samples finely enough that a local unprivileged
# process watching it can infer secrets from another process's power signature
# (PLATYPUS, CVE-2020-8694), so the counter was restricted to root.
#
# Relaxing it to a group re-opens that side channel to members of that group.
# On a single-user desktop that is usually an easy trade; on a shared or
# multi-tenant machine it is not. Decide deliberately -- this script will not
# make the file world-readable.
#
# Nothing here is needed for GPU wattage: amdgpu's hwmon power sensors are
# already world-readable. This is only about the CPU half.
#
# Undo with:  rm /etc/udev/rules.d/99-fanhypr-qs-rapl.rules && reboot
